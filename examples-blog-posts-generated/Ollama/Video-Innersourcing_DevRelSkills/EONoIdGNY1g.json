    "blog_post": "**The Importance of Community in Inner Source: The Role of Internal DevOps**\n\nIn the realm of software development, the concept of inner source is gaining traction as a way to harness the collective knowledge and expertise of an organization's employees to drive innovation and growth. However, building a successful inner source project requires more than just technical expertise; it demands a deep understanding of community dynamics and collaboration.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the significance of community in inner source projects and introduce the concept of internal DevOps, a specialized role designed to foster and nurture these communities.\n\n**The Role of Community in Inner Source**\n\nCommunity is at the heart of any successful inner source project. By tapping into the collective knowledge and experience of its employees, an organization can create a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement. A strong community also enables the sharing of best practices, knowledge transfer, and skill development, ultimately driving business growth.\n\n**Introducing Internal DevOps**\n\nTo effectively manage and nurture inner source communities, organizations need dedicated staff with specific skills and expertise. This is where internal DevOps comes in â€“ a specialized role designed to facilitate community building, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the organization.\n\nInternal DevOps professionals are responsible for:\n\n1.  Facilitating open communication and collaboration among employees.\n2.  Identifying and addressing community needs and pain points.\n3.  Developing strategies to engage and retain contributors.\n4.  Creating and implementing processes to encourage continuous improvement and innovation.\n\n**Key Skills for Internal DevOps**\n\nTo excel in this role, internal DevOps professionals should possess a unique blend of technical and communication skills, including:\n\n1.  Technical expertise in software development, DevOps, or related fields.\n2.  Strong communication and interpersonal skills to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n3.  Ability to analyze community needs and develop effective strategies to address them.\n4.  Experience with open source ecosystems and communities (optional but beneficial).\n\n**Mentorship and Community Resources**\n\nFor organizations looking to establish an internal DevOps role, there are several resources available to provide guidance and support:\n\n1.  Open Source Foundations, such as OSI or Linux Foundation, offer mentorship programs and best practices for community building.\n2.  Industry events and conferences provide opportunities to learn from experienced professionals and network with peers.\n\nBy acknowledging the importance of community in inner source projects and establishing a dedicated internal DevOps role, organizations can create a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement, ultimately driving business success.",

    "transcript": "yeah uh thank you so much Daniel for the\nintroductions this way I don't need to\nself introduce myself on the topic uh I\nthink you Daniel uh introduced myself\nreally well uh working at the Linux\nFoundation um most of the time uh I'm\nworking in two specific lenos Foundation\nproject one is to group the other one is\ndeveloper relation Foundation that uh\nthat project is just starting and we're\njust like in the intent to form actually\nbut really excited uh for for this new\ninitiative to take shape and in the my\nuh spare time I also try to contribute\nto all the open source projects as much\nas I can here at inner Source Commons uh\nalso chaos or open chain uh related to\nmy background I consider myself some\nsort of hybrid I really started actually\nin marketing and then I wanted to uh get\nmore into technical skills so that's why\nI started a master in data science uh\nwhen I was in my previous uh job at pgia\nand uh recently I finished another\nMaster more into the front and side\nbecause I felt like I was missing some\nskills uh more from the front end uh I\nwas more in back end uh because of the\ndata science master so I decided to also\ntake some Knowledge and Skills on that\nuh to help me in my day-to-day job as\nproject manager uh so that's\nmyself and um before I starting to the\ntopic of today I wanted to share with\nyou a use case uh this is anonymous and\nuh was actually a a open source scenario\nthat I faced\nuh but I've changed it a bit to uh meet\nwith inner Source case and this way I\ncan explain better why I want to talk\nabout the importance of developer\nrelations skills what are really\ndeveloper relations because that is a\nreally wide term and depending on the\nperson you talk to they're going to be\nuh diff uh defining it differently and\nwhy is so important when uh dealing with\ncommunity why is so important the aspect\non community in in our source and the\nproject you are in our sourcing\nso let's think about uh in a company\nwhatever an XY Z company uh there is a\ndeveloper or a group of developers uh\nworking in one of the business units of\nthe company and uh they're always\ninteracting with an internal API to uh\nget some queries on certain data to to\nhave some data and they said oh uh we\njust found that or we found that there\nare some end points that uh we can uh\nimprove the security uh and and we can\nfind some sort of solution that finds\nAPI and points with potential\nvulnerabilities so they're starting to\ndevelop uh this kind of solution uh to\nas a library or something to to include\nand uh this group of developer developer\ntalk to their manager the manager can be\na CDO or there can be a inner Source\nprogram office manager so what whoever\nis reporting\nto uh but overall to be a person that\nhas a holistic view of what's going on\nin the company and what's going on in um\nin the engineering team and uh that\nperson understands if that solution that\nthose developers are developing can be\nvaluable\nfor other business units or other um\nteams within the organization so this\nmanager sees that potential see that\nthat can help deficiency on other\nbusiness units and by Inner sourcing\nthat uh it can it can get great benefits\nin terms of developer efficiency and uh\nand don't Reinventing the wheel so the\nmanager said hey why why not in our\nsource I think this can help many other\nthe open source projects in know the\nbusiness\nunit so from that um the developer or\ngroup of developers um that now we're\ngoing to call it like original\ncreators um starts working with\ndifferent teams to enable this uh\nproject to be inner source to be s in a\nrepo can be GitHub or can be gitlab uh\nfor other business units in the\norganizations to have access and to be\nable to see that code and we and use it\nand even make\ncontributions so they need to take to go\nthrough some text um and and bypass uh\nand so that they are working with the\nlegal team they are working with the\nsecurity team uh they are working with\nthe platform team even and any other\nteams that need in order to be\ncompliance ready and in order to meet\nlike all the automations and be aligned\nwith the internal processes and policies\nof the\norganization uh and that is going to be\ndone through an issue tracker as I\nmentioned it can if it's GitHub it will\nbe like GitHub issues if it's GitHub it\nwill be gitlab issues whatever any issue\ntracker they want to choose\nand uh they might be one two three po\nrequest if it's g g up so when they are\nserving the code uh into the platform\ncode that can be any any of these\noptions and they won't be only serving\nthe code but they will be uh serving\nlike a quick start guide contribution\nguide or when me file so you know we are\ntalking it's not just a group of\ndevelopers serving the code for all the\nbusiness units to to see we are talking\nof um of a project that has good initial\ndocumentation for actually a community\nto start working on it like they they\nhave a quick start guide for anyone to\nuse locally they have an AP notice they\nhave a vulnerability RIS disclosure so\npeople for instance if they see any\nsecurity issues they can report and they\nknow how to report for this specific\nproject and so on so we are talking on a\nproject that has not just the code but\nalso uh like clear documentation to get\nit\nstarted um so once that is done uh they\ncan finally merge that P request they\ncan finally share this with all the\nbusiness units in the company and this\nis really really excited because all the\nwork that these developers have been\nputting\nuh to to have this project to solve an\nissue that the manager mentioned that\ncan be also help all the business units\nis finally out there and all the people\ncan see it and all the people can use it\nand it's if it's a if the creators of\nthose code can be really really excited\nthat this is finally\nhappened so and in a positive scenario\nin an ideal scenario\nthe next that what what happen next will\nbe seeing the project Bloom and the\noriginal Creator will see how what they\ndid um is helping others so they will be\nexpecting uh more adoption and more\nusage of that project uh maybe they will\nbe expecting new contributors joining to\nimprove that and to uh Ser frequent\nupdates of that solution uh there will\nbe some maintenance of the project and\nmaybe in the future uh the initial use\ncase will lead to other use cases that\nthey weren't thinking so the\nfunctionality of this solution will\nexpand and this is a really positive\nscenario because if we go back to this\nthe the use case that I said when the\nthe developer were working with all\nthese teams um I don't think I don't\nknow if you if you saw this but I never\nmention anything around Community or\nsome any team um helping on on the\ncommunity side of that and that is\nreally important because without\nCommunity uh all those\nexpectations can can never happen and\nand the reality might be really sad\nbecause all the efforts all the\nresources I spent maybe it just gets\ninto that and I've uh inner Source this\nproject but that inner source project\nnever gets attention never gets\nusability never gets contributions and\nit's really really frustrating\nfrustrating especially for those\ndevelopers that spended the time to make\nthat project iners into an inner source\nproject um and that harms not just the\ndevelopers but also the the company uh\nso for the developers I I already\nmentioned some of the risks that can\nlead to that so the developers can lost\nrecognition\num they can be less motivated maybe for\nthe next time they might say like no I\nhave all things to do because well I\ndidn't get like a lot of uh I I did not\nget recognition I did not get something\npositive from my last experience uh they\nmight be V missing a learning\nopportunity so when there is a community\nand there is feedback and there is\nsomeone else sharing information on ways\nto improve the original creator also\nlearns from that and if there is no\nCommunity if there is not that feedback\nthat opportunity is missed and they\nmight find some sort of imposter\nsyndrome like all the time spent into\ngetting that project outside I mean not\nwithin the like within the organization\nbut outside their their team um it it\nwasn't as expected and also for the\ncompany and I think this is really\nimportant can also take some risk uh for\ninstance Around Talent retention\nchallenges if the developers they don't\nfeel motiv it maybe those developers\nmight be more um thinking more about oh\nmaybe this is not my role maybe I should\nmove to another role uh the resources\nthat they have been expending to Inner\nsource that project not just for the the\ndevelopers uh working on that project\nbut also the hours spent from the\nsecurity teams the hours spend from the\ncompliance Sim to make that project\ninner Source uh for not nothing because\nat the end it it just was released and\nand and the activity stopped there and\nuh what is really\nreally um a difficult thing also might\nbe an erosion of trust in inner Source\nmaybe the company might think well why\nare we spending resources why are we uh\nspending time of our developers to Inner\nSource this this is not working this is\nnonsense\nand it's that is completely a false idea\nbut because their experience is telling\nthem that if this is not working they\nmight be feeling that and that can put\non risk the concept of inner sourcing\nproject because of this\nresource um allocation they they feel\nlike it's taking too much time and it's\ninefficient and so on and all all of\nthat is because the part of the\ncommunity wasn't maybe so important at\nthe beginning it was really more I and I\ntotally understand right like companies\nare going to spend more time on the\ncompliance security because there that\nis a direct risk for them uh the bad\npart of this is that Community usually\ndoesn't feel like a high\nrisk uh a high direct risk but when you\nthink on the indirect risk it's really\nreally important because if you don't\nthink to put Community First at the very\nbeginning then you have spent so many\nresources to get something but then the\npart of the grow and sustainability of\nthe project is is nonsense security and\ncompliance is great but it's not going\nto save you uh from from all this growth\nof the community and the security of the\ncommunity if there are not other topics\nuh taken put on the table at the very\nbeginning um and and that's why I feel\nlike there is a the importance of having\nthis holistic approach uh when in or\nsourcing a project and this is a\nlearning that I took from the open\nsource Fair um and that's why I wanted\nto talk about the importance of building\ndeal skills um and I wanted to bring it\nto now to the open source faere because\nwell I'm I'm working now as a project\nmanager for an open source Foundation\nthat is the Linux foundation and part of\nmy job is related with the brother\nskills and um when thinking about that\num I felt like when doing inner Source\nthere is a lot of things that um these\nskills can be applied also when with\ninternal\ncommunities um and I I wanted to bring\nit this to the table so for instance\nthis is an example that I do do in my\nday-to-day work as open source manager\nuh I have to facilitate contributions\nand collaboration I have to be able to\nenable this knowledge sharing from\ncontributors um I do advocate for\ndevelopers or if there are not\ndevelopers or any other contributions to\nthe project and hear and do active\nlistening uh an a to to build trust and\nuh build the community and I also have\nto build use cases for others to get\ninspiration of oh uh this can be a path\nto follow and maybe there are others\nthat have any other ideas and do promote\nsome sort of um let let the community to\nexperiment and to fail and to try right\nso all that needs a lot of skills that\nis not just the\ndevelopers uh having someone or a group\nof people capable to manage that\ncommunity and capable of uh doing this\nuh facilitation and this encouragement\nand this\nmotivation uh and planning the strategy\nof the\ncommunity uh planning the roles the\ndifferent escalation paths and\ncareer uh ladders for the contributors\nlike all this kind of uh planning and\nstructure and Strat y around Community\nis important and and having someone\ncapable of uh doing that and having\nthose skills is important and also even\nwhen we are talking about internal\ncommunities so from the open source Zeal\nuse case that is the one that I've\nshared with you and this comes from an\nopen source Foundation that is a\ndifferent topic I I just wanted to put\nhere on the\ntable um what about moving that skills\nand having these internal Dev RS and uh\nthe saying that there are um security\nteams and the same way that there are um\ncompliance team uh working with those\ndevelopers to get that project in\noursource having a staff a professional\nstaff uh capable to lead um the grow and\nnurture this internal contributor\ncommunity and here are some cross fun\nskills that I think uh these people must\nhave a mix between Technical and\ncommunication so uh I've heard a lot of\nfor instance in in chudu group there are\na lot of opo Open Source prom office uh\nleaders and uh they they work closely\nwith a lot of uh people internal people\nuh with Communications skills but they\nlack of technical uh skills and\nsometimes I mean that that is good on\none side because that Communications\npeople usually understand the needs of\nthe company and uh how the comp the\ndifferent business units communicate but\nthey lack the open culture that for\ninstance if you come from an open source\nspere if you come from the technical\nside maybe you're going to understand\nbetter so finding someone or a group of\npeople able to speak the both language\nis\nimportant um and here were just like\nsome skills that um I feel like it's\nimportant when dealing with community\nthat can be also put into perspective\nwhen uh developing this idea of the\ninternal Devas for inner Source projects\nto take care of the\ncommunity and um and just to put it as a\nwrap up uh I'm not going to spend more\ntime in into disco because I I also want\nto spend a few minutes for open\ndiscussion and see what people think uh\nfirst of all I feel that um when in our\nsourcing a project uh having a holistic\napproach that puts Community\nFirst uh in the whole pipeline of and\nand workflow on when starting from idea\nto fully inner Source in a project it's\nreally important I understand that\ncompanies are obsessed and especially\nthis year with security and\ncompliance uh but security and\ncompliance is just the starting point if\nthey want to scale they need the\ncommunity um the other thing is uh if\nCommunity is so important thinking about\nhaving dedicated staff and I I I wanted\nto introduce this internal Dev R but\nit's not just about it's not not about\nthe world de world but more about the\nskills that Dev world might have and I I\nfeel that if that person whatever you\nchoose or that team whatever you choose\nhave some sort of Open Source experience\nof experience when managing open source\necosystem is a plus because it's as I\nmention is not just having knowledge on\nthe community but knowing how open\ncollaboration works works and open uh an\nopen source works so they can implement\nit when doing this uh inner source and\ndeveloping this internal Community to\ncontribute uh to new projects incubated\nprojects in in inner Source fair and uh\nfinally of course there are open source\ncommunities uh like in our source\nCommons uh de Foundation that can\nprovide mentorship in case you feel like\noh I want to learn more about this new\nroles or how to get more involved into\ninner s from a community perspective\nthat can help uh these people and and\nthese Specialists to uh share uh their\nperspective with peers and learn from\npeers and um yeah that's that's the\ntopic I wanted to talk about with you\ntoday and uh as I mentioned um I I\nwanted to spend some time also to do\nthis open discussion to to hear your\nthoughts on what do you think about this\ninternal deil is your company uh\nactually having some sort of role about\nthat uh what is the like how how\nimportant is that role in your company\ndo you feel that is something if if your\ncompany doesn't have that is something\nthat you feel that is needed and yeah\njust just having that open discussion\nand from that I will stop sharing",
