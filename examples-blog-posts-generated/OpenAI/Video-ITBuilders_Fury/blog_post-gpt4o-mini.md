# Revolutionizing Software Development: How Mercado Libre’s Internal Development Platform, Fury, is Shaping the Future

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the pressure to deliver high-quality applications quickly and securely has never been greater. Mercado Libre, a leading e-commerce platform in Latin America, recognized this challenge and transformed its internal software development processes with an innovative platform known as Fury. This article delves into the evolution of Mercado Libre’s software development, highlighting how Fury optimizes the developer experience, ensures security, and improves overall efficiency.

## Understanding the Problem

Software development at scale presents numerous challenges. As organizations grow, they need to maintain application availability, enhance user experience, and uphold security standards. Developers are often bogged down by repetitive manual tasks and the complexity of managing multiple technologies. Key user expectations include:

1. **Availability**: Users expect applications to be up and running at all times—nobody enjoys a slow-loading app or one that frequently crashes.

2. **Quality**: End-users want software that functions smoothly, and developers require tools that can maintain and enhance that quality consistently.

3. **Security**: With cyber threats always looming, it’s imperative to have systems that comply with security protocols and protect sensitive user data.

4. **Developer Experience**: Developers crave efficient tools that reduce manual overhead, allow them to focus on innovation, and support the latest technologies.

These expectations often conflict—pressure for speedy development can lead to shortcuts that compromise quality or security. Thus, Mercado Libre sought a balanced approach that would enable quick, secure, and high-quality software delivery.

## The Fury Solution

Enter **Fury**, an internal development platform (IDP) designed to streamline and optimize software development processes. Fury offers teams a centralized point of access to manage their development life cycles, including building, deploying, and performance monitoring. Let’s break down how Fury tackles the primary challenges mentioned above.

### Comprehensive Abstraction

Fury provides a layer of abstraction over various cloud services, allowing developers to focus on application logic instead of platform intricacies. By integrating multiple cloud architecture—like AWS and GCP—Fury helps developers select the appropriate resources without getting overwhelmed by the choices available.

### Speedy Deployment

One of the most significant advantages of using Fury is the drastic reduction in the time it takes to deploy applications. Developers can create and launch applications that can handle public traffic in just **30 minutes**, compared to several hours with conventional tools. This efficiency enhances speed to market and allows the company to remain agile amidst changing user demands.

### Automated Governance and Security

Fury automates various governance and compliance checks that developers would otherwise need to manage manually. For instance, it integrates vital security checkpoints— such as vulnerability scans for libraries— to ensure that only secure code is deployed. With these built-in protections, developers can proceed confidently, reducing the chances of unintentional breaches.

### Machine Learning and Predictive Scaling

Another remarkable feature of Fury is its capacity for predictive scaling powered by machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can analyze application performance and adjust infrastructure requirements dynamically, ensuring optimal resource utilization without manual intervention. Developers benefit from intelligent insights that help reduce costs while maintaining application performance.

### Efficient Development Lifecycle Management

Fury enhances the development process with a structured approach:

- **Quick Application Setup**: Developers can quickly set up new applications, automatically generating the necessary repositories, pipelines, and monitoring mechanisms.

- **Quality Control**: Integrated quality checks are implemented before an application can go into production, ensuring that developers maintain high standards from day one.

- **Centralized Observability**: Fury centralizes logs and monitoring data, making it easier for teams to track application performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned

The evolution of software practices at Mercado Libre has not been without its challenges. Transitioning to a more automated and integrated platform like Fury required significant effort, including:

- **Cultural Shift**: Convincing teams to adopt new technologies can be difficult, particularly in a landscape where developers may be attached to familiar workflows.

- **Data Privacy Compliance**: Across Latin America, adhering to various data protection regulations while using a multi-cloud architecture can be complex and requires ongoing attention.

- **Resource Optimization**: Balancing costs while maximizing resource efficiency demands continuous tweaking and learning from past deployments.

These challenges have taught Mercado Libre invaluable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of a strong developer experience. By prioritizing developer feedback and iteratively refining Fury, they created a platform that not only meets immediate needs but also positions them for future growth and challenges.

## Real-World Application and Market Relevance

The insights gained from the development of Fury aren’t limited to Mercado Libre. Any tech company can benefit from applying the principles Fury embodies. In today’s fast-paced environment, organizations of all sizes can learn from this approach to:

- **Foster a Developer-Centric Culture**: Prioritize developer needs to enhance output and job satisfaction, ultimately leading to better products.

- **Embrace Automation**: Utilize automation tools to minimize repetitive tasks and focus on strategic initiatives that drive business growth.

- **Implement Robust Security Practices**: Security should be a foundational element of product development, not an afterthought. Tools like Fury's automated checks can serve as models for other organizations looking to bolster their security posture.
